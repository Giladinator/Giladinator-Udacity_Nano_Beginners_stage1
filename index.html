          The <b>web</b> or the <b>Internet</b> are a network of computers that commuincate
          with each other via a known protocol called <b>HTTP</b>. <br>
          This protocol is used to send a wanted URL or website address to the server for example: <a href="www.youtube.com"> www.youtube.com </a><br>
          The server finds the requested page and sends it back to the user in HTML and the browser reads the file and displays it to the user.

          <b>HTML</b> = Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
          Text = content (or what?)<br>
          Markup = How? (or how you display the content)<br>
          HTML can display content such as pictures <img src="https://www.emojimeanings.net/img/whatsapp-smileys/grinning-smiley-in-a-good-mood-whatsapp-emoji-1F600.jpg" alt="Smily picture" </img>
          and videos as well.<br>
          HTML documents are made of <b>elements</b> and we use <b>tags</b> to define them.

          <h3>Whitespace</h3>
          HTML ignores white space so it doesn't matter if (for example) the sentence is written in one line
          or not.
          <h3>Are computers stupid?</h3>
          In a sense yes, they can do a lot but only exactly as told, if they do something different than expected,
          it is most likley because of us, the programmers.
          <h3>Inline vs block</h3>
          HTML elements can exist inline or as a separate block that has an "invisible box" around it.
          <h3>Squares everywhere</h3>
          A web page is built from squares within squares or tiles.
          <h3>Classes</h3>
          We can name elements by using "Class", this is used later with CSS to avoid repetition and to allow for quicker and easier changes.

            <h3>Stracture</h3>
            HTML documents are like trees, where different elemenets are branching from each other.<br>
            <!--For example the text above is brached of <p> element -->
            <h3>HTML-CSS-DOM</h3>
            If HTML is the language that creates the page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the style of the page.<br>
            DOM or Document Object Model, is a way to interacts with objects and models of HTML.<br>
            <h3>Boxes</h3>
            In an HTML document, everything is boxes. This is helping us with arranging the objects webpage.<br>

              <h3>Understanding CSS</h3>
              Cascading means that the most specific rule applies
              <h3>Using semantic tags</h3>
              Use tags that make sense, it is important to allow for easy reading and later with search engines.
              <h3>The Box revise</h3>
              Content<br>
              Padding - clear area around the content<br>
              Boarder<br>
              Margin - Transparent, space between boxes.<br>

              ms<br>
              box-sizing: boarder-box;<br>
              <h3>Code test refine</h3>
              Repeat until perfect, you can't test too much really.
              <h3>Verify HTML and CSS</h3>
              It is important not to let the browsers guess and to check the code.
